# parceltest
Test project to try Parcel. For testing reasons it also uses React, eslint, prettier, PostCSS. Deployed to Netlify: [willitmiss.netlify.app](https://willitmiss.netlify.app/).

The project is created as a part of tutorial by Remy Sharp available on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Introducing_complete_toolchain#introducing_our_case_study). Nothing is coded by me.
